# Samsung Flip3 5G KVM Port
The Samsung Flip3 5G Port of KVM (Beta and not fully released)

Limts:
- You cant run vms with more than 8GB RAM, 4 cores and 512GB Storage
- You can only run 6 vms because the phone itself has 6core cpu
- Internet works only NAT
- No Bluetooth (Seriously)

Stuff We made in this
- ARM/ARM64 to x86 support (Speed of the vm is like running it bare metal i5 11th gen 11600K)
- RDP Support/VNC Support
  

Here is an image that shows an windows 11 kvm running on my samsung z flip3 5g
